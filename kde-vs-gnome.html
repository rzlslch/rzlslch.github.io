<p>I don&#39;t usually post an opinionated note, but this is 2025 and I&#39;ll try to write something.</p>
<p>Honestly, I much more prefer Gnome than KDE (plasma). This is totally personal preferences but I have my reasons.</p>
<p>I heard a lot of people (on the internet, ofc) said that KDE (plasma) is the best desktop. It&#39;s customization is superb, no longer <em>krashes</em>, and so on. And that Gnome sucks, the devs were assholes, no customization, and so on. Truth to be told, that&#39;s not what I have personally experienced. </p>
<p>Before that, I&#39;ll talk about my journey in gnu/linux world.</p>
<p>My journey began at my uni in 2010, and my first distro is Ubuntu 10.04. It comes with old gnome 2 desktop, and I like what I had at that time. Time goes on, I try to stay on linux as long as possible, and still maintain Windows on my machine at that time with dual boot for uni&#39;s task that requires Windows&#39;s application and/or for gaming (linux gaming practically almost non-existent at that time besides emulator). I still use old gnome, but with such customization that it didn&#39;t resemble gnome at all. Then gradually, I moved to wm only (my first wm was subtlewm) but occassionally I switched back and forth to gnome. The good ol&#39; ricing day. I&#39;m totally comfortable with navigating my workspace using keyboard only, and managing window(s) using keybinding (shortcut) was my joy in life.</p>
<p>Then I stumbled upon Archlinux, and it&#39;s been mostly my daily driver til much later (with a lot of reinstall, ofc, being archlinux and all). Being a gnome user for a long time, my first choice was to install archlinux with gnome. Not long after that, gnome change its direction (gnome 3) with something that I do not actually hate, but rather it&#39;s just something that I&#39;m not comfortable with yet at that time. Gnome 3 actually was eye catching at first, but with its humongous top panel and title bar, my 1366x768 screen feels too cramped and since then I abandoned all things related to gnome and take a full dive in wm-only environment. Openbox was my favorite back then, and xmonad second. But I occassionally tried other desktop environments on my other machine just because. Gnome, KDE, Xfce, Mate, even Pantheon. I&#39;m just that like that.</p>
<p>Then I graduated. I was working as a programmer and try to use Archlinux as much as possible. Until I switched company, and my new workplace issued a work-related laptop that was preinstalled with Windows. Now, I have several machines. Work-issued laptop using Windows, my desktop then became a Windows machine too (for gaming and working purpose, mostly for gaming though), and my personal laptop that still on Archlinux. I used my personal laptop just for browsing on the internet and small projects, nothing serious. But I still prefer using my customized wm-only Archlinux than my other 2 windows machines.</p>
<p>Life happens. I got a steady job, gotten married, have kids, operating system didn&#39;t matter, let alone desktop environments. I just use what I had at the time, mostly windows on my work-issued laptop. My desktop was so last decade I didn&#39;t bother to do anything on it. My personal laptop was, gone. I don&#39;t remember exactly how, but it&#39;s out of the picture. Wether I donate it or it&#39;s broken I forgot. I have no real linux machine.</p>
<p>Then last year, I built a new pc. And I specifically choose all <strong>&quot;red&quot;</strong> because I heard it&#39;s great with linux, since open source and all. So I built my pc with ryzen as the cpu, and radeon as the gpu. At first I installed Fedora on it because that&#39;s what I have ready on hand. It&#39;s working alright. Fedora being a Gnome distro, comes with authentic gnome experience, and, yeah. Gnome actually not bad. Not bad at all. It&#39;s good rather. It feels so polished. It&#39;s true that the customization is limited but I didn&#39;t really care. All my needs are covered, the gesture was nice, the keybinding was on point, and the workspace management was, I don&#39;t know, automatic(?), I guess. It&#39;s like having a tailored experience. This is maybe what they call &quot;<strong>The Gnome Experience</strong>&quot; that I could only appreciate recently. I have already tried gnome shell long time ago, and I already know what is what within, but I never realized its purpose, or rather, its excellence. Only when I embraced it and accept it for the way it is, I could finally see why.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t want to turn this into gnome circlejerk, so TL;DR, I tried gnome after a long time and it&#39;s actually good, coming from a tiling wm enjoyer.</p>
<p>Next is my experience with KDE Plasma.</p>
<p>The last time I tried KDE Plasma was when they released plasma 6. I tried to set up my plasma desktop the way I want, mimicking what Unity desktop had before, with global menu and all, integrated window button on the left side of global menu, launcher on the left side. You know, because that&#39;s what plasma was advertised, customization. And I don&#39;t know why, I broke my desktop. Global menu behaves weirdly. Sometimes it shows menu, sometimes it doesn&#39;t. And sometimes it crashed with error popup. And then the launcher. Using plasma default panel, I moved to left, vertical. And then I tried to rearrange it so that any widget/plugins beside launcher was moved to top panel alongside global menu. I messed it up. When drag n drop&#39;ing from panel to another panel, the widget/plugin detach itself from the panel, and attached itself to the desktop. Then I have to click it again, and I thought I had to drop it to the top panel but, I was wrong. It disappeared. I don&#39;t know where. Okay, so I just need to add the same widget/plugin to the top panel manually. But the problem is, I don&#39;t know the name. So I guessed the name and try some with similar name or meaning. I&#39;m kinda bad at this.</p>
<p>That left me a bad impression. I kinda fed up and went back to gnome. Let&#39;s try to wait for some time til it was stable enough, I thought.</p>
<p>And then, not long ago, I tried KDE Plasma, again. One or two weeks ago. I guess global menu is a no no based on the last experience. I tried using it vanilla. It&#39;s.. okay, I guess? It reminds me a lot of Windows, with less polished menu layout. It kinda overwhelm me. When I opened dolphin, so many clutters(?) to put it into words. I don&#39;t really enjoy the feeling. The sidebar, the layout button, zoom, even the volume bar information. It feels too cluttered for me. And it feels so rigid(?). There&#39;re so many lines.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#39;s the theme, I thought. I tried to change the theme. There&#39;re a few choices. Breeze, Oxygen, and something I can&#39;t remember. Nothing good for my eyes. So I tried to install a third party theme. Funnily enough, I got an error again. It failed to connect or something it says. I tried to refresh repeatedly until it could display the third party themes. Let&#39;s pick one of them, I thought. I choose Nordic(?) or something, it&#39;s downloading, and then error again. What is this? Is this &quot;The KDE Experience&quot;? I got a little fed up and tried to stick with the default theme.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s try to do something more productive. I opened code editor, and try to do some work. I did some projects on mobile platform. I spun up emulator, and start coding again. Usually, to avoid confusion, I placed my code editor and emulator on different workspace so I can focus on one thing at a time. I usually moved my window using keybind (shortcut), so I look for it in plasma. I can&#39;t move my window to next workspace. What gives? There&#39;s no next workspace. I need to create it first. How? I have to go to overview. By? Dragging my mouse to left corner of the screen, then click &quot;+&quot; button. Can I automate this process somehow? I don&#39;t know, maybe? Will I bother? No.</p>
<p>It&#39;s too windows-like, or more like, too mouse-centric. I already accustomed to keyboard-centric workflow. Some may argue, it&#39;s just fraction of seconds to switch to mouse and then back to the keyboard. It&#39;s not about how long, but how many energy I have to put up with it. It eventually piles up and kinda destroy the focus. How about creating a perfect environment then? The argument is, you can do what you want with kwin scripts, or customize its keybind, something something customization. The reality is, I don&#39;t want to do it. I have no energy to fiddle with customization anymore. If it&#39;s the young me, the me in my uni days, I might prefer plasma since I&#39;m crazy about customization. I even wrote a lot of scripts to use in tandem with my tiling wm to make an interesting desktop screenshot to post on r/unixporn. But that day was no more. I don&#39;t want to tinker. I don&#39;t want to rice. I want my desktop environment as an app launcher and stay out of my way, not a canvas to paint. Why spend so much time in something as vain as tinkering with desktop when I can just install another desktop that suits my need?</p>
<p>KDE Plasma is clearly not for me.</p>
<p>That being said, Gnome is not without its flaws either. But for now I can kinda put up with it. It can be solved with one or two simple solution. Like, how can there&#39;re no systray when there&#39;re many applications that can only be relaunched with it? One of them that I use is FDM. I just install an extension and be done with it.</p>
<p>And I kinda like how gnome handles application menu. It&#39;s a drawer that display list of apps, kinda like mobile app. It&#39;s easier to navigate and I can just type the name in overview. </p>
<p>Yeah, I think that&#39;s it. Maybe Gnome is for people like me.</p>
